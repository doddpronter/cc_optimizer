## üß† What This Tool Does

`cc_optimizer.ipynb` analyzes covered call options across all tickers listed in `stocks.txt` and calculates key features to help you identify the most attractive contracts based on reward vs. risk.

Given Schwab option chain data, it computes the following for each contract:

Let:

- **S** = underlying price  
- **K** = strike price  
- **B** = bid price of the call option  
- **DTE** = days to expiration  

Then it computes:

- **Stock Return Cap**  
  `stockReturnCap = max(0, K / S - 1)`

- **Premium Return**  
    ```
    if K < S:
        premiumReturn = (B / S) - (S / K - 1)
    else:
        premiumReturn = B / S
        ```


- **Annualized Premium Return**  
`annualizedPremiumReturn = (1 + premiumReturn) ** (252 / DTE) - 1`

- **Cost for 100 Shares**  
`costForUnderlying = S * 100`

- **Breakeven Point**  
`breakevenPoint = S - B`

- **Downside Protection**  
`downsideProtection = B / S`

- **Dollar Return on Premium**  
`dollarReturn = premiumReturn * costForUnderlying`

---

You can **sort and filter results in real time** to identify the highest yielding covered call setups based on return, downside protection, or breakeven price.
